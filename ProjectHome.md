I am OFFICIALLY DEPRECATING this code base due to lack up of support.  I apologize but there is no one left to maintain this project.  Hopefully some will be able to take advantage of the code and build something useful for themselves!

BITE is a suite of tools that lets you test the web from the web, offering tools that inform and accelerate manual and exploratory testing. It is currently available as an extension for the Chrome browser.

BITE offers:
  * In-browser bug reporting which grabs context.
  * Test suite management.
  * Visualization of bugs that have already been filed against a page.
  * Automatic recording and playback of user actions on a page.

The extension must be connected to a server to fetch information on bugs, tests, and new bug templates. See the wiki for more information on the necessary server extensions.
